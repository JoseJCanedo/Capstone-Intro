## Course Overview & Foundation

---

### **What is a Capstone?**
- **Definition:** Culminating academic experience that integrates learning
- **Purpose:** Bridge between academic knowledge and professional practice
- **Outcome:** Portfolio-ready project demonstrating technical competency
- **Industry Connection:** Real-world application of IT skills

**Note:** *That this isn't just another class project - it's their opportunity to showcase everything you've learned and create something you can present to future employers.*

---

### **Course Learning Outcomes**
By the end of this course, you will:
- Design and implement a complete database-driven application
- Apply agile project management methodologies
- Collaborate effectively using professional development tools
- Present technical solutions to diverse audiences
- Demonstrate professional IT competencies

---

### **Project Requirements Overview**
**Technical Requirements:**
- Database component (design, implementation, optimization)
- Web-based or desktop application
- User interface
- Data validation and security considerations

**Note:** *These are subject to change based on the agreed upon project with the professor. Databse is a requirement for all.*

**Process Requirements:**
- Agile/Scrum methodology
- Bi-weekly sprint demonstrations
- GitHub version control and collaboration
- Professional documentation

---

### **Team-Based Learning**
- **Team Size:** 3-4 students per team
- **Rationale:** Mirrors industry collaboration
- **Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers (rotating: everyone will be playing these roles)
- **Accountability:** Individual and team assessments of the overall project

---

### **Sprint Demo Format**
**Every Two Weeks:**
- 10 minutes per team
- Responses to other teams demos
- Show what you have worked on, not slides
- Explain what you built, challenges faced, next steps
- Professional presentation skills expected

---

### **Example Project Ideas**

- **Student Organization Portal** - Event planning and member management
- **Personal Finance Tracker** - Budget management with analytics
- **Learning Management Extension** - Course resource organization
- **Community Service Coordinator** - Volunteer opportunity matching
- **Health & Wellness Tracker** - Personal health data management

**Note:** *Projects must have sufficient complexity for a semester-long effort*

---

### **Technology Flexibility**
**Database Options:**
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB
- Must justify choice based on project needs.

**Note:** *I prefer MongoDB since it is free and data is stored in easy to read JSON*

**Development Platforms:**
- Web: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue
- Backend: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Java, C#
- Desktop: Electron, Java, C# WinForms
- Mobile: React Native, Swift, Kotlin

---

### **Team Meeting Guidelines**
**Process:**
1. Introduce yourself (name, strengths, interests)
2. Discuss complementary skills 
3. Exchange contact information
4. Discuss initial project interests and preferred frameworks.

**Note:** *Don't pick a framework or language only one person knows or is comfortable with. It can be a .*

---

### **Team Contract Elements**
**Each team must establish and submit in writing:**
- Communication protocols (when, how, frequency)

**Brainstorm 3-5 project ideas as a team**

---

### **GitHub Setup**
**Why GitHub?**
- Industry-standard version control
- Collaboration and code review
- Portfolio development
- Professional skill demonstration

**Setup:**
1. Accept GitHub Classroom invitation - will be in your emails no later than week 2 of class.
2. Create team repository
3. Add all team members as collaborators
4. Initialize with README.md

---

### **Professional Expectations**
**This is your capstone - act like professionals:**

- Maintain professional documentation
- Respect intellectual property and academic integrity
- Seek help early when needed

---

### **Deliverables**
**Due by end of Week 2:**
1. **Team Contract** - Establish working agreements
2. **GitHub Repository** - Created and configured
3. **Project Ideas List** - 3-5 initial concepts with brief descriptions including database type, programming language, and frameworks for each concept

**Submission:** Upload to Cougar View

---

### **Looking Ahead - Week 2**
**Next Week We'll Cover:**
- Agile methodology fundamentals
- Requirements gathering techniques
- Database design principles
- Sprint 1 planning
- Project scope refinement

---

### **Success Mindset**
**Remember:**
